This is the first project in [The Odin Project] (https://www.theodinproject.com).


I got a better understanding of how to use HTML markups and how to wrap elements in divs. Also got a better a feeling in basic CSS including how to use flexbox and in general I got more comfortable with moving elements around the webpage.
